# Starling Builder extensions

####Overview

Starling Builder extension is the place you can extend Starling Builder without modifying the [editor](https://github.com/yuhengh/starling-builder-editor).

Build the swfs here and simplily drop them into the YOUR_WORKSPACE/libs.

For the time being, you can build your custom UI components into EmbeddedComponents.swf and build your feathers theme into EmebeddedTheme.swf.
